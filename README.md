# Eclipse-Data
Mapping out most recent and future eclipses across North America
The Eclipses.ipynb file is the code that shows the use of the BeautifulSoup python package to extract eclipse data from the web. That allowed me to download the data as KML files (google earth files).
Then I used the ArcPro Software to convert each KML file into a shapefile, using a for loop
Once the data was converted, on Eclipses 2, I did simple maps of the appearances of the Eclipses's totality in North American territories.
